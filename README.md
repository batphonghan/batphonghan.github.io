** StaderLabs | KernelDAO**

Protocol Engineer \(Rust, Go, Move\)

Jan. 2022 - Present

● **KernelDAO Infrastructure — Rust & Async Network Systems **

○ Designed, optimized, and fine-tuned KernelDAO’s indexing infrastructure to support 2M\+ daily users and facilitate weekly Eigen and Kernel token distributions to over 1M users.

○ Built high-throughput async data pipelines leveraging Rust \(async/await, Tokio\) with AWS Lambda and DynamoDB to ensure fault-tolerant, low-latency indexing and distribution at scale.

● **Stader Node Operations & Backend API — Ethereum Infrastructure **

○ Architected and managed the Stader-node system to coordinate multiple Execution and Consensus clients, powering Stader EthX with over $500M TVL.



● **Solana | Terra Liquid Staking Protocol — Rust Smart Contracts **

○ Contributed to the design and operation of Terra’s Liquid Staking Protocol, implementing Merkle-tree-based token airdrops and CosmWasm reward utilities in Rust, achieving a peak TVL of $1B.

● **Multichain Staking Services — Rust & Move Ecosystems **

○ Engineered liquid staking solutions across Aptos, Sui, and Solana using the Move language and Anchor Framework.

○ Developed cross-chain smart contracts and backend components in Rust, optimizing async communication between chains and validators for reliability and scalability.

** TrionOne **

Protocol Engineer \(Rust, Go\)

Apr. 2021 - Dec. 2022

**High-Performance Asynchronous Proxy System — Rust, Tokio, Hyper **

● Developed a high-performance proxy server in Rust, leveraging async/await, Tokio, and Hyper to process thousands of concurrent RPC requests with minimal latency.

● Optimized throughput and responsiveness through efficient asynchronous I/O and a multi-tier caching architecture \(Redis → Backblaze → Google Bigtable\).

● Achieved up to 20× latency reduction for RPC requests to Solana validators, substantially enhancing network reliability and performance.

● Built complementary components including a Block-cache service, Cloudflare Worker, and Pyth network publisher, collectively accelerating validator query performance by 10–20×.
